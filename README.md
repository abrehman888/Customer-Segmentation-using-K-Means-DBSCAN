 ## Overview
This project applies K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms on the Mall Customers dataset to segment customers based on their Annual Income, Spending Score, and Age.

## 📊Dataset
Mall Customers dataset (available in data/mall_customers.csv)
### Features used:  
Annual Income (k$)  
Spending Score (1-100)  
Age  
## ⚙️Steps Involved  
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding distributions and relationships.  
 K-Means Clustering:  
Finding the optimal k using Elbow Method & Silhouette Score.  
Visualizing clusters in 2D and 3D.  
DBSCAN Clustering:  
Comparing results with K-Means.  
Handling outliers and varying densities.
